## **Website Structure**

* The website is structured into 9 principal pages
* All of the pages extend the same base, therefore producing a consistent style across the web-app
* Pages are the following:
    * **Navbar**
    The navbar is structured up very easy for the user, with a button and the header "**My Blog**", dropdown menu with "**categories**", where all the blog-categories are stored. A "**Register**" button for new users, and a "**Login**" button for the ones with registerd accounts already.
    ![navbar_as_logged_out](static/readme_images/navbar_logged_out.png)
    
    * If the user is logged in, the navbar says: same "**My Blog**" button, and "**Categories**" dropdown menu, but then we come to the "**Add Post**" followed by "**Add Category**" since you can do this stuff as logged in. To the right, we find another dropdown menu, where the user sees the profile-name, the dropdown menu has 4 links. "**User settings**", "**Edit Profile Page**", "**Show profile page**" and a "**Logout**" button. 
    ![navbar_as_logged_in](static/readme_images/navbar_logged_in.png)

# **Testing**

## **Introduction**

  Throughout the development stages of the website, we have conducted rigorous testing to ensure its quality and reliability. 
  This testing process involved various methods and tools, including:
  * Python Terminal for Backend Functionalities: We extensively used the Python terminal to test and validate the functionality of the backend of our website. This allowed us to interact directly with the backend components and ensure they were working as intended.
  * Google Developer Tools: Google Developer Tools played a crucial role in our testing process. It helped us inspect and debug the website's frontend components, ensuring that they were rendering correctly and functioning smoothly.
  * Manual Testing: Our team conducted thorough manual testing, where we interacted with the website as end-users would. This hands-on approach allowed us to identify any user interface issues, navigation problems, or functional glitches.
  
  By employing this comprehensive testing strategy, we have ensured that our website meets the highest standards of quality and provides an exceptional user experience.

## **Testing Accessibility and Performance**

* Testing for accessibility and performance is made from Google Chrome extention, called Lighthouse extension:

    * For Desktop:
    IMAGE PÃ… RESULATAT 

    * For Mobile devices:
    IMAGE PÃ… RESULTAT

## Validator Testing 
The HTML was validated using 

![W3C HTML Validator](readme-assets/html-validator.PNG) 

- My JavaScript was validated, without errors with 

![ExtendsClass](readme-assets/JS-validator.png)
- CSS showed no errors aswell, and validated with 

![Jigsaw W3C Validator](readme-assets/css-validator.PNG)

## Lighthouse
- The google chrome has a very good built-in performance-tool that is called Lighthouse.
  OK results, but unfortunatly CodeAnywhere are slowing down my rating on performace (prestanda)

## **Ongoing bugs:**

# **Development and deployment**
Throughout the development of this project, we utilized GitPod as our primary development environment. We maintained a disciplined approach by consistently committing and pushing our code to GitHub. This version control process allowed us to meticulously track and document the evolution of our website's development. It's worth noting that our GitPod environment was established using a template thoughtfully provided by Code Institute.

For users who wish to deploy this website locally, we will provide detailed instructions below. Additionally, we'll outline the steps required for deploying the website to Heroku, our chosen hosting service. We opted for Heroku primarily because of its robust database management capabilities, which align seamlessly with the needs of our website.

## **Local Deployment**

1. GitHub Login: Begin by logging into GitHub.

2. Select Repository: Locate and select the repository titled pphilippersson6/my-blog.p4

3. Copy Repository URL: Click on the "Code" toggle button within the repository and copy the URL (e.g., https://github.com/pphilippersson6/my-blog.p4.git).

4. Clone the Repository: In your integrated development environment (IDE), open the terminal and execute the git clone command using the copied URL (e.g., git clone https://github.com/pphilippersson6/my-blog.p4.git).

5. Repository Cloned: This action will clone the repository into your working environment.

6. Create the env.py File: Generate an env.py file and include it in the project's root folder. This file should typically be included in .gitignore to prevent public exposure. Add the following code to the env.py file, ensuring that you provide the relevant key-value pairs with correct values:

import os

os.environ['SECRET_KEY'] = 'ADDED_BY_YOU'
os.environ['DATABASE_URL'] = 'ADDED_BY_YOU'
os.environ['CLOUDINARY_URL'] = 'ADDED_BY_YOU'

7. Install Required Packages: Install the necessary packages specified in the requirements.txt file.

8. Configure Database Settings: In the settings.py file, configure the connection to either the Heroku Postgres Database or the local SQLite database.

9. Set Debug Mode: For local development, ensure that the DEBUG variable in the settings.py file is set to True.

10. Allow Local Host: Add localhost and 127.0.0.1 to the ALLOWED_HOSTS variable in the settings.py file.

11. Check Migrations: Verify the migration status by running python3 manage.py showmigrations.

12. Migrate the Database: Execute python3 manage.py migrate to perform the necessary database migrations.

13. Create Admin User: Use python3 manage.py createsuperuser to create a super/admin user for the application.

14. Start the Application: Finally, start the application by running python3 manage.py runserver. This will launch the local development server.

These steps will allow you to clone the repository and run the project locally with all the required configurations and dependencies.

## **Deployment to Heroku**

1. Create a Heroku Account: Start by creating an account on Heroku.

2. Create a New Heroku App: In your Heroku dashboard, create a new app and choose a suitable name for it. Additionally, select your desired region for hosting.

3. Database Configuration: Due to changes in the PostgreSQL Add-on, it's recommended to use ElephantSQL for your project's database instead of Heroku Postgres. Follow these steps:

4. Create an account on ElephantSQL.
Click on 'Create an instance'.
Provide a name for your plan, select the appropriate plan, choose a region, and data-center closest to your location.
After filling out the details, click 'Create instance'.
Copy the DATABASE_URL from your ElephantSQL dashboard and paste it into Heroku Config Vars in the app's Settings. Make sure your env.py in your project IDE also uses the same URL.
Environment Variables: Ensure that the DATABASE_URL is set as an environment variable both in Heroku's Config Vars and your local IDE's environment variables.

5. Create a Procfile: Generate a Procfile in your project directory with the following content: web: gunicorn project_name.wsgi.

6. Config Vars: Add your environment variables (from env.py) to Heroku's Config Vars.

7. Debug Mode: Set the DEBUG variable to False in the settings.py file.

8. Allowed Hosts: Add 'localhost' and 'project_name.herokuapp.com' to the ALLOWED_HOSTS variable in the settings.py file.

9. Check Migrations: Run python3 manage.py showmigrations to verify the status of your migrations.

10. Migrate Data: Execute python3 manage.py migrate to perform the necessary data migration to the database.

11. Create Admin User: Use python3 manage.py createsuperuser to create an admin user for the application.

12. GitHub Integration: Connect your Heroku app to GitHub and enable automatic deploys from the 'main' branch. Alternatively, you can choose to manually deploy.

13. Deploy: Click 'deploy' to initiate the deployment of your application to Heroku.

By following these steps, you'll successfully deploy your project to Heroku, taking into consideration the necessary configurations and database changes.
